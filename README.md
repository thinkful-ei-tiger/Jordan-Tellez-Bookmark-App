Bookmark Inc.

The user can bookmark multiple websites and be able to filter by rating. When the user clicks the add button, the app expands so the user can input the title of the website, give the site a rating between 5 stars and 1 star from the dropdown, and add a description. URL must include HTTP/HTTPS. The form can reset and canceled if needed by the user. 
Once the site is bookmarked, the user can click on the link to visit the site.
Lastly, the user can delete the bookmark links that have been saved.

Check out the Bookmark App for yourself!
